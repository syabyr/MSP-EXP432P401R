See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

If you are running with the as-shipped firmware then you can leave
uart_init uncommented.  It is already setup to work. Mine was shipped
using DCOCLK at 3MHz, so if you want to use the uart init change the
baud rate divisor register as noted in the code. 

If you have run flash01 and wiped the main flash so that the bsl is
now running, then you need to uart init so uncomment the uart init,
which uses a divisor for 12mhz.

/dev/ttyACM0 is where I find the uart data

You should see 0123456701234567 forever, no skips in order, might need
to enable wrap on your terminal program.
