This code uses the ARM's systick timer.

With an erased user flash the BSL is likely running and it appears to
have the ARM clock set to 12MHz.  With the timer set to roll over at
12,000,000 ticks, wait for 10 rollovers and that is 10 seconds the
led changes state every 10 seconds.

The as-shipped app appears to be running at 3MHz which is a strange number
10 times counting to 12 million took 40 seconds. 120million/40 = 3
million ticks per second.  Dumping regs it does appear that we are running
off of DCO clock and it is set to 3MHz.  At least the as-shipped firmware
that my board came with.
