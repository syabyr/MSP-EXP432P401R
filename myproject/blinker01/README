See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

At the moment this code assumes that you have the stock firmware that
came with the board loaded.  At some point I will wipe mine and then
likely have to init the gpio before using it...

I dont have the flashing figured out yet, just jtag via openocd to sram
so the sram version is here, see top level readme for loading and
running.
