See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

If either of the user buttons are pressed (P1.1 or P1.4) then the P1.0
led comes on, otherwise it is off.

The schematic shows that the switches short the pin to ground, or zero
to detect not shorted, we need to "pull up" the input to 1 using a
pull up resistor, so we need to enable the resistor and select pull up.
DIR = 0 input, REN = 1 resistor enabled, OUT = 1 pull up.

If the pin 1.1 or 1.4 input reads as a 1, then the button is not pressed
so if either 1.1 or 1.4 is zero then the button is pressed.
