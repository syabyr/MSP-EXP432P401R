Wow, this worked, this chip is super easy to program the flash, almost
scary.  The manual talks about verification, I enabled the hardware
stuff but didnt do the infinite loops of trying until it all clears
and writes correctly.

If you have the as-shipped firmware or at least the stuff I had on mine
then you can run this as is, this will blow that firmware away, you have
been informed.  It replaces it with a simple blinker program basically
blinker01.

If you have run flash01 and erased the flash then uncomment uart_init
and use the 12mhz setting.

If you have run flash02 and written the blinker program then it appears
like the as-shipped demo application the default is DCOCLK at 3MHz, so
to use this program again and see the uart work (and perhaps to have it
work at all) uncomment uart init and uncomment the 3MHz baud rate divisor
or just let it blast out the uart 4x too slow (28800 baud), not sure
how the xds110 handles that.
