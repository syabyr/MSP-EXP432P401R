See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

same as flash02 but has even less stuff in the blinker binary turns
off WDT and thats it doesnt change the gpio.

Takes a few seconds to run, after running once, and reset/power cycle
to run the new flash.  you can uncomment uart_init(), set for 3MHz and
watch the output, if you didnt see it the first time.
